<p>
This work presents a tool for 3D visualization of software structures and dependencies that can be integrated in the software development process.
The analysis of the existing tools has shown that the visualization should be platform and language-independent, based on standard technologies and provide a well-defined input format. One key solution to meet this requirements is the web-based approach to generate and display 3D representations of software structures using X3DOM.
</p>
<p>
The dependency view shows a new approach for visualizing dependencies within the hierarchical structure of the project. The analysis and subsequent classification of the input dependencies allows a fine-grained representation. This leads to a clear overview even for large-scale projects and will help to understand the structure and dependencies of software for reuse, maintenance, re-engineering and reverse engineering.

<p>This project started as a master thesis as the National ICT Australia
	in Sydney. Thanks to Franck Cassez and Ralf Huuck for the help during
	the thesis.</p>
	
<p>The example files are created by the Goanna tool. <a href="http://redlizards.com/">Goanna</a> (http://redlizards.com/) is a
	static program analysis tool for C/C++ software projects based on model
	checking. The technology has been developed at National ICT Australia
	(NICTA) in Sydney since 2005. Goanna can be easily integrated in the
	software development process by a seamless integration into Microsoft
	Visual Studio and the Eclipse IDE.</p>
